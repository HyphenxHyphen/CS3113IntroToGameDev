Theme is, of course, FANTASY FOOTBALL
Except, by Fantasy I meant D&D-type fantasy
And by Football, I meant magic spell (It's actually the projectile attack of an Archmage. He won't miss it, he can make another)
Extra balls not included (He ran out of mana)

A winner announcement will appear at the center of the screen

Please wait 2 seconds for the game to load
The ball speeds up over time
