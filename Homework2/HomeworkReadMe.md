The code can be found in main.cpp, the assets in Assets. Make sure the assets are in the project folder by adding the Assets folder to the project folder. Then, you might want to add the assests from the Assets folder to VS.

There is a paddle to the left (Militia), paddle to the right (Goblin)
Control the Militia with W S
Contorl the Goblin with UP DOWN
Press T to play single player

Ball (Arcane Ball) will bounce off all walls and paddles
Ball will stop upon touching the left or right wall, which will end the game


Theme is, of course, FANTASY FOOT BALL
Except, by Fantasy I meant D&D type fantasy
And by Foot Ball I meant magic spell (It's actually the projectile attack of an Archmage. He won't miss it, he can make another)

A winner announcement will appear at the center of the screen

Please wait 2 seconds for the game to load.
