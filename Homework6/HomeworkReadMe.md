Special thanks to: 
- Thiago and Sel for helping me with ant design and art
- [PizzaMZ](https://twitter.com/PMozzar3lla/media) for bugs
- My D&D party for putting up with my scheduling conflicts and helping me playtest
- Prof Cruz for reviving my obsession with game dev and coding (I will never forgive Unity)

Requirements:
- `deltaTime` check, `Entity` is now `EntityController` and `SpriteRenderer`, `Map` is in there, but I didn't use it because I didn't need to. Instead, I hope `SlicedImageRenderer` is a good enough replacement, as it does basically the same thing. `Scene` check.
- 2D game, I made like an RPG and Turn-Based
- New assets yup, check out that font lmao
- Menu screen, with text, `scene0`
- Definitely more than 2 minutes of gameplay, but you're not getting far. 1? Level? and it is huge. You could also say it's like, 13 smaller levels. The map (`scene1`) scrolls! 
- There are at least 3 different AI, they all behave the same way though... sorta. They get random moves, but their move-choosing algorithm is all the game. Pick a move, pick a valid target. They hop on turn start, they move forward to attack, and the reel back when hit!
- If your ant runs out of HP, you lose!
- If you defeat all enemy bugs, you win! A single battle. And then there's another battle...
- Audio check, there's 1 looping bgm (High Quality Video Game Music), and 1 sound effect (Button A)
- There's a screen transition of fade-in, fade-out
- The text color changing on `scene0` upon being hovered is a logic-based shader effect (it really is as simple as I like)

Okay, with that out of the way, there's not really much to talk about for this final project! For the showcase and technical details, watch the video!

I have a good system in place to add in more units and more moves easily, so I plan on doing that once I have some time. 
If you check the assets folder, there are some ants that were drawn (thank you Sel, once again), and the plan is for each bug to eventually have full designs and sprites.

Lemme see if I can get this on Steam...

Thanks for everything this semester!
